## What is Invisible Text?

**Invisible text** is created using special Unicode characters (like `„Ö§`) that are not visible to the human eye.  
These characters are detected by systems but don‚Äôt appear on screen. That makes them perfect for:

- Creating unique usernames on social media.  
- Sending ‚Äúblank‚Äù messages on WhatsApp, Instagram, or Facebook.  
- Styling text or separating sections without normal spaces.
